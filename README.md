# linuxserver/muximux

This is a lightweight portal to view & manage your HTPC apps without having to run anything more than a PHP enabled webserver. With Muximux you don't need to keep multiple tabs open, or bookmark the URL to all of your apps. [Muximux](https://github.com/mescon/Muximux).

## Usage

```
docker create \
  --name=muximux \
  -v <path to data>:/config \
  -e PGID=<gid> -e PUID=<uid>  \
  -e TZ=<timezone> \
  -p 80:80 \
  linuxserver/muximux
```

**Parameters**

* `-p 80` - the port(s)
* `-v /config` - Where muximux should store its files
* `-e PGID` for GroupID - see below for explanation
* `-e PUID` for UserID - see below for explanation
* `-e TZ` for timezone setting, eg Europe/London

### User / Group Identifiers

Sometimes when using data volumes (`-v` flags) permissions issues can arise between the host OS and the container. We avoid this issue by allowing you to specify the user `PUID` and group `PGID`. Ensure the data volume directory on the host is owned by the same user you specify and it will "just work" â„¢.

In this instance `PUID=1001` and `PGID=1001`. To find yours use `id user` as below:

```
  $ id <dockeruser>
    uid=1001(dockeruser) gid=1001(dockergroup) groups=1001(dockergroup)
```

## Setting up the application

Find the web interface at `<your-ip>:80` , set apps you wish to use with muximux via the webui.
